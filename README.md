# probability_compound_events_calculator
simple probability calculator for compound events, both dependent and independent.

Major upgrades will include a GUI and an explanation system of each input the user will put in.  This is intended to be a layman's probability calculator.

Current trial limit for Dependent events is set to 20; this is due to the integer limit in C++.  Plan to switch the factorials (currently long long ints) into arrayNums, similar to the independent event functions.  This will allow escaping the int limit.  Other smaller optimizations planned.
